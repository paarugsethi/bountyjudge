If you have been following the crypto space recently you may start to notice a new trend, physical and traditional financial assets are being introduced into the blockchain making it tradable in a decentralized market or as the tech bros call it, it is being “tokenized”

imagine converting your solana directly into apple stock, sounds crazy right? but thats actually possible now but what does all of this really mean? let me enlighten you.

Introduction

This phenomenon is called Real world tokens or RWA for short. it refers to the process of tokenizing real world financial assets into the blockchain for decentralized access, which means no single party has any authority over what its users do unlike a bank or any other financial institution which actively monitors and has the ultimate say in rendering its services.

Tokenization refers to the process of transforming any asset into a digital representation on the blockchain.

RWAs essentially eliminate the need for a middle man, So instead of needing a bank or broker, you can buy, sell, or earn money from these assets using crypto apps.

Here is a good example to crystalize the concept:

You own part of a building by holding a token.
You earn interest from a government bond but through your crypto wallet.
You buy a fraction of gold or Apple stock without needing a stock exchange.
Why RWA? why now?

But this ends up begging the question, are RWAs actually needed? if it was really important why has the financial sector done really well without it for decades? is it just another crypto fad?

Well, to understand that we must first understand the benefits RWA brings:

1. Stable & Predictable Yield

Crypto-native yields like staking etc can be volatile or unsustainable. RWAs like bonds or T-bills offer steady returns backed by real world cash flows while maintaining secrecy.

2. Boosts Liquidity

Assets like real estate or private debt are hard to trade. Tokenizing them brings liquidity, fractional ownership, and 24/7 markets, allowing more poeple to participate hence pulling more money into these assets.

3. Bridges TradFi & DeFi

RWAs connect traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi), letting people access real-world investment opportunities directly from their wallets bridging two major financial sectors.

4. Global accessibility

RWAs end up connecting markets around the world providing a loophole to strict regulations and access restrictions various countries have put in place, RWA removes this barrier & opens up markets to a worldwide audience.

5. Fractional ownership

Fractional ownership refers to the ownership of a part of a token or asset so instead of owning the entire pie which would cost you a huge sum of money, you can buy that same asset for a much cheaper price by buying a smaller chunk out of the bigger pie

After covering these benefits it becomes pretty obvious how disruptive and beneficial RWAs can be, however like all things in life there are some disadvantages that come with it.

The bad side of RWAs

RWAs like any other assets also has its fair share of drawbacks like:

1. Legal recognition

Many financial institutions are hesitant of making such a big change suddenly, hence not recognizing it as a legal tender or medium of trading assets

2. Regulatory uncertainty.

Ultimately the government determines how the usage of crypto is done hence can impose certain laws and restrictions that affect the flow and financial markets of the RWA tokens

3. Tax complexity.

Crypto has had a notorious relationship with taxes due to how tricky and difficult it can get to track maintain and pay taxes on gains earned through cryptocurrencies

4. Complexity

RWAs currently require a learning curve to be able to trade and invest in it, ensuring you get the maximum returns and also protecting your assets from unauthorized parties and unforeseen loses due to market conditions

5. Incompatibility with traditional systems.

Some financial systems were never designed to be traded through digitally hence raising the question of incompatibility of its assets with the blockchain.

Following the money, a brief look into the origin of RWAs

To understand where RWAs currently stands in our world let us first dive into the process it underwent that led it here.

1990, the beginning

As the world started to develop, the need for an better asset class emerged and exchange traded fund or ETF was born which was the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY). it was the first centralized tokenization of an asset, it comprised of the top 500 companies in the US stock market & started trading in 1993 & remains one of the most popular and stable assets to this day.

1994, smart contracts?

As technology advanced, bringing in more computing power and complexity, Nick Szabo a computer scientist created the terminology “smart contracts” which referred to a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract, although it is to be noted there was no motive of creating internet money or cryptocurrency out of this, it merely remained a feat in computer science.

2009, Hello bitcoin

An unknown person going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto launches the tech and the whitepaper for an internet coin called “bitcoin”, which is a decentrailzed peer to peer network where exchange of value can be done through the bitcoin network trading bitcoins, nobody knew it then but this single event created one of the most undisputed asset class out of thin air & will form the basis for future crypto coins.

2014, Hello tether

A new crypto currency called tether was introduced, it aims to be the first US backed stable coin, meaning it will be in 1:1 ratio to the US dollar, so 1 tether = 1 US dollar, this aimed to legitimize, stabilize & provide additional liquidity to the markets and it worked!

2015, Hello Ethereum

Vitalik Buterin, a Canadian computer programmer launches the Ethereum network and ether which aimed to execute smart contracts on chain providing real world use case and validate the concept & need for crypto currencies beyond simple asset transfers

2018, Legal stuff

The introduction of ERC-1400 tokenization provided a agreeable and valid framwork for legalizing to some extend the issuing, transferring & managing security tokens in an decentralized network

2021, To the moon

The exorbitant rise in the prices of cryptocurrencies in the 2021 bullrun led financial institutions to find ways to take part in the investing, trading and transfer of cryptocurrencies while following legal compliance, hence further legalizing and solidifying its place in the assets market.

2023, To the assets

After big financial institutions realized how profitable cryptocurrencies can get, a new trend arose with the emergence of tokenizing real world assets onto the blockchain, and led us to where we are right now.

RWA, the story so far

Now that we know how the crypto markets evolved and finally led us to RWAs, it makes sense to analyze the current state of the market and the progress it has made so far.

Currently the total RWA onchain is valued at $24.83B, with the total holders being 279,998. However these numbers remain ever growing.

the top networks here are Ethereum with $131.8B followed by TRON with $77B followed by Solana with $9.9B followed by Arbitum with $6.5B.

Stocks

The emerging trend is the tokenization of stocks, primarily from the US stock market & this was started recently in 2025, here the assets are linked to the price of the stocks in real life in 1:1 ratio. These include popular stocks like apple, meta, tesla, nvidia etc

Key players/coins in RWA

Analyzing top real world assets (RWA) coins by market cap.

1. Chainlink (LINK)

Chainlink is an decentralized oracle network which plays a crucial role in RWAs which is to securely bridge off-chain data to on-chain environments meaning to connect real world data, price movements and other information to the blockchain, Chainlink is the global standard for developing advanced blockchains applications that are highly secure, compliant with existing regulations, and integrated with existing legacy systems.

2. Stellar (XLM)

Co-founded by Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim, Stellar is known for its interobility between different financial systems, networks, and blockchains. Stellar also provides a way to reach consensus without relying on a closed system to accurately record financial transactions.

3. BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL)

BUIDL is a tokenized money market fund for institutional investors. It offers a dollar-backed digital asset that combines the speed of blockchain with the stability of traditional finance. Investors can own and trade it on-chain, with instant and transparent settlement.

4. ONDO

ONDO is a permissionless DeFi protocol that enables users to create fixed-yield, risk-tranched loans using yield-bearing crypto assets as collateral. It operates on a peer-to-pool model, with no intermediaries, allowing for capital-efficient structuring and programmable risk exposure.

5. Quant (QNT)

Quant is an Ethereum token that is used to power Quant Network’s Overledger brand of enterprise software solutions, which aim to connect public blockchains and private networks.

6. Algorand (ALGO)

Algorand is a fast, low-cost, and energy-efficient blockchain that lets people send money, build apps, and run smart contracts. It’s designed to support a decentralized economy where anyone can participate. Like Ethereum but cheaper and faster, Algorand uses its native token, ALGO, for transactions and to reward users who help secure the network.

Conclusion

So as you can probably tell by now RWAs are here to stay, going from $5B in 2022 to over $24B by June 2025, showing no signs of slowing down it is here to stay, and soon it will simply become too big to ignore. This is like buying bitcoin in 2009 😉.
