Why Real World Assets Matter?

Real World Assets, or RWAs, are quietly changing the way finance works.

Imagine you own a shop in a small town. You’ve got land, stock, and daily sales, but it’s all offline. Now someone tells you — what if we could digitise all of that and make it tradable globally, instantly, with full records? That’s what RWAs do to traditional finance.

RWAs refer to assets like bonds, real estate, commodities, or credit that are tokenised and brought onto blockchain networks. They take things that used to exist only in paperwork and spreadsheets, and put them into code — usable by anyone, anywhere.

If crypto wants to be more than just speculation, it needs to absorb the massive world of traditional finance. That includes the trillions sitting in fixed deposits, mutual funds, loans, and government securities.

And Solana is positioning itself as the go-to infrastructure to make that happen. Low fees, fast speeds, and a dev community that doesn’t sleep.

RWAs are the wedge. Solana is the tool.

Traditional Finance vs Web3: The RWA View

Let’s be honest — traditional finance in India can be frustrating. You want to send money on a weekend? Banks are closed. You want a loan? Get ready for 10 forms and 15 days.

Now compare that to the dream of Web3. You click a button, the transaction is done. Smart contracts replace layers of middlemen. Settlement is 24/7, and everything is auditable.

RWAs try to bring the trust of traditional finance and combine it with the flexibility of crypto. For example:

A US government bond token that behaves like a stablecoin
A real estate property that can be bought and sold like a stock
A private loan structured in a way that DeFi protocols can understand

Solana provides the rails to do this efficiently. It’s like switching from regular trains to a Vande Bharat. Same destination, much faster ride.

RWA Growth Around the World

Let’s look at the scale of what’s happening globally.

In 2022, the total value of RWAs (excluding stablecoins) was around 5 billion dollars
By mid-2025, it’s crossed 24 billion dollars
That’s nearly 5 times growth in about two years

Tokenised US Treasuries alone have gone from around 100 million dollars in January 2023 to more than 7.5 billion by June 2025. That’s not just growth — that’s momentum.

Why is this happening? Because people want yield, transparency, and better access. In a world where interest rates fluctuate and inflation eats up returns, RWAs provide a reliable way to park money and still earn.

What’s Happening on Solana?

Now let’s zoom in on Solana’s numbers.

Over 350 million dollars worth of tokenised RWAs
The average transaction volume per wallet is around 40 million dollars
Over 10 billion dollars worth of stablecoins
More than 140 billion dollars in stablecoin transaction volume every month

These are not small numbers. Solana is not just about NFT drops or meme coins anymore. It’s becoming a platform where serious financial activity is taking place — quietly but steadily.

Big Institutions Are Already In

When big names like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton move in, you know something’s serious.

BlackRock — BUIDL Fund

BlackRock launched a tokenised US Treasury fund called BUIDL. It started on Ethereum but later expanded to Solana, simply because Solana is cheaper and faster.

Think of it like launching a product in Delhi but opening another outlet in Bangalore because the customers are more tech-savvy and the rent is lower.

These BUIDL tokens can be used in DeFi applications as collateral, giving traditional assets a new life in the on-chain world.

Franklin Templeton — Benji Token

This one’s simpler. You can buy shares of a US government fund using USDC (a stablecoin). One token equals one share. You can buy it from your phone.

It’s like investing in an FD using Google Pay — simple, compliant, and fast.

Apollo — Private Credit on Solana

Apollo’s ACRED fund brings private credit markets to the chain. Investors can earn yields of up to 16 percent. That’s way higher than what most Indian fixed deposits offer.

They use a mix of permissioned tokens and open DeFi rails — kind of like using UPI with a PIN and biometric check for larger amounts.

Other Names: Kraken, xStocks, Jupiter

You can now trade tokenised versions of real-world stocks like Tesla and index funds like the S&P 500 on Solana. And it works round the clock — you could literally buy at midnight in your pyjamas.

Why Solana Works for RWAs

One major reason why Solana stands out is the experience it offers to developers and users.

Blocks are confirmed every 400 milliseconds
Fees are fractions of a rupee
It can handle thousands of transactions per second

In Indian terms, it’s like switching from 2G internet to fibre broadband. Things just work faster.

Solana also has specific token features that help in handling RWAs securely:

Confidential transactions for privacy
Interest-bearing tokens for predictable income
Transfer restrictions to meet regulations

It’s built not just for fun apps, but for serious money.

The RWA Ecosystem on Solana

Here’s a simplified breakdown of the players:

Treasuries & Bonds — BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Ondo
Private Credit — Apollo, Maple, Credix
Real Estate — Homebase, Parcl
Stocks & Equities — Kraken xStocks, Backed Finance
Commodities — VNX Gold, Uranium Digital
Stablecoins — USDC, USDT, and even digital Euros and Swiss Francs
Bridges & Infra — Securitize, Pyth, Wormhole

There’s even a project that tokenised a house in Texas. People could buy shares of that house and receive rent payments in stablecoins. It’s like buying a tiny part of a flat in Gurgaon and earning rent every month.

Regulation is Being Taken Seriously

This is one area where Solana is playing the long game.

Franklin’s Benji token is already registered with the US SEC.
Homebase followed proper legal channels to sell real estate as tokens. BlackRock doesn’t need an introduction — they wouldn’t touch this space without legal clarity.

Compared to other chains where regulation is still a grey area, Solana is already onboarding funds that have dotted every i and crossed every t.

Challenges That Still Exist

Of course, not everything is perfect.

Liquidity can be limited because many tokens are still permissioned
Retail investors may feel left out due to legal restrictions
Some user interfaces are still not intuitive — too complex
Niche assets like tokenised uranium don’t have big demand yet

These are growing pains. But the progress so far shows that things are moving forward, not backward.

What’s Next? What Could Be Possible?

Let’s dream a little.

Could Indian investors buy tokenised gold bonds or fixed deposits globally?
Could salaried employees invest small amounts in US real estate via apps like Groww?
Could businesses use tokenised invoices to get faster credit?
Could RWAs help digitise local co-operatives, mutual funds, or school land assets?

Even if just one percent of the world’s financial assets move on-chain, that’s over 4 trillion dollars — larger than India’s entire GDP.

Why This Actually Matters

Behind all the code, regulation, and investment — this movement is about access.

It’s for the farmer in Nigeria who wants to store value safely.
It’s for the 23-year-old freelancer in Bangalore who wants global exposure.
It’s for the housewife in Ghana who wants her savings to earn more.

RWAs bring real-world assets to digital rails. Solana makes sure those rails are fast, affordable, and accessible.

We’re not just building new tech. We’re building new bridges — ones that connect money, people, and opportunity.

In Summary

Solana has proven that it’s not just a fast blockchain. It’s a platform ready for real-world finance.

The shift from paperwork to programmable capital is already underway.

We’re moving from “why tokenise?” to “why not?”

If the last decade was about DeFi and NFTs, the next one will be about bringing the rest of the world along.

And it might just run on Solana.
