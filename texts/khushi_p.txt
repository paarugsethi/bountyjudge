1. Introduction

Let’s start with the basics. RWAs stand for Real World Assets.

These are things like U.S. treasuries, private loans, real estate, gold, stocks, and carbon credits. Note that, they aren’t crypto-native tokens, but the financial instruments for a real economy.

Categorization of RWAs

Traditionally, these assets have been stuck in slow, permissioned systems.

Think of how banks, brokers, and custodians handle them with layers of middlemen, a ton of paperwork, and long settlement cycles. It can take days to move money, access is limited and liquidity is often locked up or delayed.

Traditional Finance Systems VS Tokenized RWAs

But that’s starting to change.

Thanks to blockchain tech, these assets are now being tokenized (meaning they’re represented digitally onchain). And once they’re onchain, they can move instantly, trade globally, and unlock new forms of liquidity and access.

This shift is already well underway:

RWAs onchain grew from $5B in 2022 to $24B+ in 2025
Tokenized U.S. treasuries alone grew 7,400% in just 18 months
Institutions like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, etc now have tokenized products live and running

So what does Solana have to do with all this?

While it started as a layer 1 blockchain known for NFTs and fast DeFi apps, Solana is now positioning itself as the go-to blockchain for RWA tokenization, especially for institutions.

This is a full deep dive into how RWAs are actually working on Solana, with all the alpha about the assets getting tokenized, the protocols behind them, the institutions coming in, and the real-world use cases already live.

Let’s deep dive into the state of RWA on Solana!

2. How RWAs Went from Hype to Real Use

For a long time, RWAs were just a side note in crypto.

People talked about tokenizing real estate, gold, or stocks, but it all felt more like a pitch deck than something actually being used. DeFi was busy with staking, farming, and launching tokens with questionable backing. The focus was on fast profits, instead of real-world value.

But when global interest rates started rising again in 2022 and 2023, the mood shifted. Suddenly, investors (both retail and institutional) were looking for safer, yield-bearing assets. In traditional markets, short-term government bonds were offering 4–5% returns. Meanwhile, stablecoins onchain were still giving 0%.

Chart showing US 10-Year Treasury Yield rising from under 1% in 2021 to over 4% by mid-2025. The rise in real-world yield triggered demand for onchain alternatives like tokenized treasuries.

This created a huge gap. And RWAs stepped right into it.

Projects started bringing tokenized U.S. treasuries, private credit, and even real estate onchain as real investment products.

The shift also changed how DeFi viewed itself.

RWAs brought in a new kind of asset that didn’t rely on hype or speculative cycles. These were tokens backed by government bonds, business loans, or rental income. And that gave DeFi something it had been missing: credibility.

At the same time, regulators started taking crypto more seriously. They were now setting clearer frameworks for what could be built. This gave institutions the green light to step in.

In short, RWAs went from being a buzzword to becoming one of the most important building blocks for the future of onchain finance.

They’re not replacing crypto-native tokens. But they’re adding stability, structure, and real-world relevance which might be exactly what this space needs to grow beyond its niche.

3. The Numbers Behind the Boom

It’s one thing to say RWAs are growing. It’s another to look at what’s actually happening.

In just a few years, the tokenized real-world asset market has gone from early-stage pilots to a multi-billion dollar industry and it’s still gaining momentum.

Here’s what the growth looks like:

In 2022, around $5 billion worth of RWAs were tokenized across all chains
By mid-2025, that number crossed $24 billion, excluding stablecoins
Some estimates say it could reach $50 billion by the end of this year
If you include fiat-backed stablecoins, the number goes over $230 billion

On Solana specifically, RWA adoption is showing strong momentum. Protocols like Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX, Ondo Finance’s USDY, and Homebase DAO have collectively pushed RWA TVL on Solana to over $1.7B as of July 2025. And that’s not counting assets bridged from R3 Corda or the incoming tokenized equity models.

So what’s getting tokenized?

➜ U.S. Treasuries

This has been the biggest breakout category. Tokenized treasuries went from $100 million in January 2023 to around $7.5 billion by mid-2025, making a staggering 7,400% increase.

Big players like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Ondo Finance are leading here, making these assets available onchain for investors seeking stable yield.

➢ Private Credit

Another strong segment is private credit, which includes loans made to businesses that aren’t traded publicly.
This category alone makes up around $14 billion of the total RWA market. Platforms like Maple Finance and Figure Technologies are making it easier to lend and borrow with tokenized loans onchain.

➢ Commodities, Real Estate, and More
Gold-backed tokens like Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT) have driven most of the $1.6 billion in tokenized commodities
Tokenized real estate is still early, but projects like Homebase on Solana are enabling fractional ownership using NFTs
Even stocks and carbon credits are being explored, with tokenized stocks reaching around $365 million and carbon credits projected to grow fast in the next few years
RWA growth since 2021 has been driven mostly by private credit and treasuries with other categories like commodities and stocks steadily catching up
➢ What’s Driving This Growth?

There are a few major reasons:

Yield: When you can earn 4–5% onchain from a U.S. T-bill token instead of holding a 0% stablecoin, it’s a no-brainer
Access: Tokenized assets are easier to access globally, without going through banks or investment platforms
DeFi Integration: You can use RWAs as collateral, earn yield, or trade them like any other token
Institutional Interest: Big names are entering the space and bringing real capital with them
4. Why Solana, though?

Ethereum still dominates when it comes to RWA value locked.
It hosts over $7.5 billion worth of tokenized assets across 300+ products.

So why are institutions like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and R3 turning to Solana?

Because Solana solves some of the biggest pain points that institutions face when moving real-world assets onchain.

Solana Blockchain’s Key Features
➜ It’s Built for Speed and Scale

Solana can process over 65,000 transactions per second and actually uses that capacity.
While Ethereum relies heavily on Layer 2s to scale, Solana handles massive volume natively.

And daily transaction volume on Solana are more than 162 million, which is higher than every other blockchain, combined.

➢ Low Fees Matter When You Move Billions

Transaction costs on Solana are consistently under $0.01, no matter the network load. For institutions moving large volumes or doing high-frequency settlements (like MMFs or structured credit), this is a game changer.

➢ Solana Speaks the Language of Institutions

This is where things get interesting.

Solana isn’t just fast and cheap. It also has native features designed for compliant finance:

Token Extensions: Add things like transfer restrictions, interest logic, and KYC hooks directly into the token itself without any need for external smart contracts
Solana Permissioned Environments (SPEs): Let institutions build private instances of Solana’s virtual machine with custom rules
Native auditability + uptime: 15+ months of continuous uptime builds trust, especially after Solana’s rough patch in 2022

These tools make it easier for banks, funds, and asset managers to build onchain without breaking compliance or legal frameworks.

➢ Big Players Are Already Here

While others are trying to convince institutions, Solana is already working with them.

Franklin Templeton deployed its FOBXX money market fund directly on Solana
BlackRock’s BUIDL fund is integrated with Solana (and six other chains)
R3 Corda, used by banks like HSBC and Euroclear, is bridging $10B+ in assets from private chains to Solana’s public layer
Ondo, Maple, Homebase, and others are building tokenized yield, credit, and real estate products on top
5. Who’s Building What on Solana

It’s one thing to say Solana is “becoming the RWA chain.”
It’s another to look at the builders and products already live.

Solana has quietly built a deep stack of RWA protocols, from global issuers to DeFi-native infra. Let’s break it down:

Overview of Real World Assets on Solana
➢ The Issuers: Big Names Going Onchain

➝ BlackRock (BUIDL) : Their $2.9B tokenized money market fund is live across multiple chains including Solana. It pays daily yield on U.S. treasuries.

➝ Franklin Templeton (FOBXX): Their tokenized government bond fund runs natively on Solana with $797M AUM. The CEO even called Solana “institutionally focused.”

➝ Ondo Finance(USDY): USDY, their tokenized T-bill, holds $650M+ and is natively deployed on Solana. They’ve also launched tokenized ETFs and built the “Global Markets Alliance” with BitGo, Fireblocks, and others.

➢ The Yield Machines: Credit & Lending

➝ Maple Finance: Lending pools now exceed $1B in TVL, spanning business loans to BTC yield. Many vaults use RedStone’s Solana-based RWA oracles.

➝ Flux Finance (Ondo): Lets users lend and borrow against RWA collateral. Built by Ondo.

➢ Real-World Assets You Might Not Expect

➝ Homebase: Fractional real estate investing via NFTs. $100 minimums. Full ownership recorded onchain.

➝ AgriDex: Tokenizing Nigerian cocoa and other agri-commodities.

➝ Convergent: A hybrid LSDFi model. Stake SOL → mint zero-interest stablecoins → earn yield via tokenized T-bills.

➢ The Infra Stack Powering It All
RedStone → Institutional-grade oracles for pricing RWAs like BUIDL and ACRED
Chainlink CCIP → Enables token transfers across chains, even to Ethereum
Wormhole Bridge → Connects RWA protocols across ecosystems
Solana Token Extensions → Native support for KYC hooks, transfer rules, and interest logic
SPEs (Solana Permissioned Environments) → Private Solana instances for regulated flows
6. The R3 Bridge: From Private Chains to Public Liquidity

Most real-world assets still live in closed, permissioned environments like R3 Corda, which is used by banks and financial institutions for privacy, compliance, and control.

But here’s the problem: they have no onchain liquidity, no public market access, and no composability.

➢ What’s Actually Happening?

In May 2025, R3 and Solana announced a direct integration.
Corda’s “notary”, which tracks asset movements, is now connected to Solana’s public mainnet.

This setup bridges both worlds:

Corda handles private workflows (loan contracts, custody, KYC)
Solana verifies ownership proofs, transaction hashes, and settlement data

It’s a hybrid model: institutional privacy meets public liquidity and 24/7 market access.

➢ Why It Matters

This isn’t just a tech experiment. This is a $10B+ bridge.
R3’s network is used by: HSBC, Euroclear, DTCC, Nasdaq, Mastercard, Clearstream and others.

Now, thanks to Solana:

TradFi firms can settle in USDC or other stablecoins
Assets from private chains can enter Solana DeFi protocols
Atomic swaps between Corda and Solana are now possible
➢ A Strategic Bet

After a deep technical review, R3 chose Solana and even added Solana Foundation President Lily Liu to its board.
This move signals a clear future: Hybrid systems, where public and private blockchains don’t compete, they collaborate.

7. The Kazakhstan Play: IPOs Meet Onchain Liquidity

RWAs have so far focused on bonds, treasuries, and credit. But now, tokenized equities are starting to enter the picture.

In May 2025, Jupiter, AIX (Kazakhstan Stock Exchange), and the Solana Foundation signed a memorandum to pioneer dual listings where Companies can list their shares both on a traditional exchange and on Solana, at the same time.

➢ What Dual Listing Looks Like

A company would:

Go public via IPO on AIX
Issue tokenized shares on Solana — transferable like any onchain asset

The setup:

AIX handles regulated IPOs
Solana provides transparency, speed, and base-layer infra
Jupiter powers DeFi trading and order routing
➢ Why It Matters

This model fuses regulatory protection with onchain flexibility.

Traditional investors get confidence and oversight
Onchain users get global access to real-world equities
Companies reach new capital sources beyond banks or brokers

Anyone with a wallet can potentially own shares in a real company, listed onchain, tradable 24/7.

➢ The Bigger Play

This isn’t just about Kazakhstan. It’s a blueprint.
If this works, expect similar models across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and maybe Europe.
And it’s not alone:

Kraken xStocks already launched tokenized U.S. equities on Solana
Bybit supports tokenized commodities and stocks via USDT
Securitize is ready to bring regulated equity products onchain

Solana’s involvement gives it a front-row seat in the global capital market transformation.

➢ What’s next?

The global stock market is worth $120 trillion. Even a 1% tokenized slice could mean billions flowing onchain.

And if Solana continues to lead on infrastructure, compliance, and liquidity, it might just become the default chain for tokenized equity listings.

8. The Real-World Challenges of Tokenized Assets

RWAs on Solana sound promising, but real adoption still faces serious challenges. Here’s what needs fixing:

➢ Custody Risk

Most tokenized assets still rely on centralized custodians.
If they go bankrupt or mismanage funds, token holders are exposed. Even regulated players like Paxos Gold are subject to strict custody rules. But many newer projects aren’t, which means risk is uneven.

➢ Oracles Are the Weak Link

Offchain data powers onchain assets , but only if the data is correct. Oracles feed price, yield, and legal status to smart contracts, but if they glitch or get manipulated, entire protocols can go sideways.

Bad feeds = bad liquidations, mispriced assets, or incorrect collateral values.

Protocols like RedStone and Chainlink are improving things, but coverage beyond treasuries and gold is still limited.

➢ Liquidity and Legal Rights Are Still Fragile

RWAs are supposed to offer instant access and exit. In reality? Many are hard to sell. If there’s no deep market or buyers vanish during volatility, holders get stuck or face major discounts.

Plus, holding a token doesn’t always mean real ownership. Many RWA tokens lack voting rights, dividend access, or legal recourse. They’re synthetic wrappers, tied to contracts that vary by region. If things go wrong, you might not win in court.

➢ Not All “Institutional” Flows Are Created Equal

While we’ve seen capital flow from crypto-native institutions like hedge funds, family offices, asset managers — traditional giants aren’t in yet.

Pensions, sovereign wealth funds, and insurance companies move slow and demand airtight audits, legal clarity, and proper reporting.

Until that structure is in place, RWAs will keep growing but won’t hit mainstream capital markets just yet.

➢ DeFi Risks Still Apply

RWAs may be backed by real-world assets, but they still run on smart contracts. That means all the usual DeFi risks like bugs, exploits, and governance flaws still apply.

A single bad contract or oracle error could cause massive financial damage, even if the asset is solid on paper.

9. What’s Next: Use Cases Waiting to Be Built

RWAs are still early. T-bills and loans are just the beginning. Solana’s speed, low fees, and programmable compliance make it the ideal chain for what’s coming next.

Here are use cases that are still wide open for builders:

➢ Tokenized Trade Finance

Global trade finance is a $17 trillion market still stuck on PDFs and manual settlement.

Tokenizing invoices, shipping docs, and receivables could unlock liquidity for small businesses, while giving global investors a way to fund real-world demand. Solana’s sub-cent fees and high throughput make it viable for these high-volume, low-margin transactions.

➢ Carbon Credits & ESG Markets

The carbon credit market could hit $16 trillion by 2034, but today it’s a mess of unverifiable offsets and double-counting.

Solana can bring transparency, automated retirement, and integration with DeFi by turning ESG into something programmable and composable. Imagine offsetting emissions through an NFT that retires carbon onchain in real time.

➢ Intellectual Property & Streaming Royalties

Creators often wait months for payouts — and split royalties with layers of middlemen.

Tokenized IP contracts on Solana can automate real-time payouts based on streams, views, or usage. Projects like NEWM are testing this for music, but the same model applies to books, films, even memes.

➢ Commodities & Agriculture

AgriDex is showing early signs with tokenized cocoa, but that’s just a start.

Onchain agriculture can give farmers direct funding, let investors trade food-backed tokens, and create transparent supply chains — all built on Solana’s low-cost ledger.

➢ Staked Yield Loops

This one’s for DeFi-native builders. Combine LSTs with RWAs for capital-efficient yield loops:

Stake SOL
Mint stablecoins against it
Use that to buy tokenized T-bills
Re-stake the yield into DeFi
➢ Critical Metals & Uranium

Uranium and lithium are still traded in closed OTC markets. Tokenizing them can open access, improve pricing, and introduce energy-based financial products. Energy-backed tokens could become a smart hedge.

➢ Small Business Debt

SMEs often get ignored by big lenders. Onchain debt pools can change that. Builders can tokenize local business revenue shares or debt deals and let communities invest directly with programmable terms, transparent returns, and DeFi-native rewards.

10. The Regulation Puzzle: Who’s Leading, Who’s Lagging

Regulation is the final boss for RWAs. No matter how good the tech is, real-world adoption depends on how friendly or flexible governments are.

Right now, regulation is fragmented. Some regions are racing ahead. Others are stuck in wait-and-watch mode. Here’s where things stand.

➢ Leading the Charge

✦ Singapore: MAS, via Project Guardian, has laid out clear rules for tokenized bonds, funds, and real estate. HSBC and JPMorgan are already active.

✦ Hong Kong: With the LEAP framework and Stablecoin Ordinance, it’s emerging as a top RWA hub. Licensed platforms are live with tokenized gold and real estate.

✦ United Arab Emirates: Dubai’s VARA has built a DeFi sandbox. Over 1,500 blockchain firms now operate here, including RWA pilots.

✦ European Union: MiCA (live since late 2024) standardizes rules across the EU for crypto assets and tokenized securities.

➢ Catching Up

✦ United States: Legal clarity is evolving. Tokenized T-bills sit in a grey zone, but SEC proposals are pushing progress.

✦ India: IFSCA is drafting guidelines. National policies are lagging, but GIFT City pilots show promise.

✦ Southeast Asia: Malaysia and Thailand are exploring tokenized markets, but most activity is still in sandbox mode.

➢ What Builders Should Know
Clarity = capital. Regions with firm guidelines are attracting more institutional money.
Token type matters: stablecoins, securities, and collectibles fall under different laws.
Compliance will be a feature. Solana’s Token Extensions and SPEs give builders a head start.

The trend is clear: global regulators are not shutting this down. They’re trying to define it. That’s a green light, if you build smart.

11. Final Take: Solana’s Real Endgame

Real-world assets are no longer a theoretical use case, they’re becoming part of crypto’s actual foundation. And Solana is establishing itself as a serious contender in this transformation.

The chain’s core strengths align well with what RWAs actually need. It’s not trying to win with hype, but with infrastructure that works.

That said, the future of RWAs won’t belong to a single chain. Ethereum still holds dominance in terms of asset volume. Private ledgers like R3 Corda continue to serve regulated institutions behind the scenes. But Solana is showing that public chains can meet enterprise standards and even offer composability that traditional systems can’t.

Whether Solana becomes the go-to settlement layer or a specialized hub for next-gen asset models, it’s already playing a meaningful role in this shift.

What happens next depends on the builders. The rails are here. The demand is real. Now it’s about turning this momentum into long-term, usable infrastructure.
