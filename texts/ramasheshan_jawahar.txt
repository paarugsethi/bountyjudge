A New Era in Finance Begins on Solana

Imagine a world where an Indian edtech startup in Bengaluru goes public twice. Once via a traditional IPO on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The second time on Solana. Instantly, investors across India’s diaspora whether in Dubai, London or Singapore can buy, trade and earn yield on tokenized shares 24/7, without intermediaries.

This isn’t fiction. It’s already unfolding.

Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like U.S. Treasuries, real estate, and public equities have surged from $5B in 2022 to over $24B in mid 2025. Treasury-backed stable-assets alone exploded 75x in the past two years. But the quiet revolution isn’t just about numbers. It’s about where this is happening. And increasingly, that answer is: Solana.

Solana a chain once associated with NFTs and memecoins is quietly becoming the global settlement layer for serious finance. In this article, we’ll explore:

How RWAs evolved on Solana
Who’s building what
Where regulation is headed
What use cases lie ahead
Why India is emerging as a regulatory and innovation hub

And why, if the internet of value is coming, Solana might be its TCP/IP. Before going deep first we understand

What are RWAs?

Imagine Priya owns a small apartment in Bangalore that she rents out for 10,000 Rs /month. Now She wants money to buy another flat, but instead of taking a loan, she tokenizes the apartment creating 100 digital tokens, each worth 1% of the property.

Now, anyone in world can buy 1 token for ₹5,000 and earn monthly rental income directly into their digital wallet.

That’s an RWA:

A real apartment (asset) shared through digital tokens (on blockchain) so people can invest easily.

This works for real estate, gold, loans, farms, or anything physical that can earn money.

Tangible Assets (are things you can see, touch, and physically use)

Real Estate
Gold / Silver / Metals
Collectibles
Cars

Intangible Assets (are things that you cannot see or touch, but they still have value to a person or a business.)

Equities
Government / Corporate Bonds
Carbon Credits
Trade Finance

What’s the purpose of Real World Assets?

Ramesh worked day and night as a delivery rider around Whitefield (india).

When his bike suddenly broke down, he needed money fast. His mother’s gold chain, worn only on festivals, was safely locked away in their kitchen cupboard. Pawning the chain felt hopeless local brokers offered half its value. Banks weren’t an option either; they were closed for two days, and even when open, they demanded endless bills, forms, and approvals that Ramesh couldn’t manage quickly.

A friend at a chai stall told him about a service where he could tokenize gold instead of pawning it.

Ramesh, desperate, carried the chain to a safe vault close to Majestic. After weighing and verifying it, they gave him a digital token in a matter of hours. He borrowed just enough that night to fix his bike; there were no middlemen, no lengthy waits, and the cost was reasonable.

After a week, he paid back the loan, received his token back, and the chain remained secure in the vault, never being taken from the family or devalued.

The main reason real world assets are being put on the blockchain is the belief that in the long run decentralized finance will give asset owners new chances and better ways to manage their assets things that traditional finance can’t offer.

How do Real World Assets work ..?

Imagine you own a small plot of land near Bangalore (india). It’s legally yours papers in hand, registered with the local office. Now imagine turning that land into a digital token so someone across the world can invest in it or lend against it. That’s the promise of Real World Assets (RWAs).

But then the question is how do we know that a digital token is actually representing a real physical asset such as your land?

The process is done in three broad steps:

1. Off-Chain Formalization : Legal verification and documentation of ownership, the same way you would register your land.

2. Information Bridging: Having done that authentication on or with the assistance of oracles, auditors, or other custodians think of it as linking your Aadhaar to your bank.

3. Demand & Supply Protocol : Creating actual use cases for the token,Ex. lending, trading or investing.

RWAs only function if individuals feel that the virtual is indeed a representation of the real. This section deals with how the perception is created.

Metrics That Matter

The rise of RWAs isn’t just a trend it’s a tidal shift. Consider:

RWA tokenization exploded from $5B (2022) to over $24B (June 2025)
Tokenized T-bills jumped from $100M (Jan 2023) to $7.5B (June 2025)
Solana leads in transaction volume per holder (~$40M)

While Ethereum currently holds a larger share of the total RWA value, Solana is a leader in user activity, over 7,200 RWA holders who transact with high velocity.”

While Ethereum laid the groundwork for asset tokenization, it’s Solana’s architecture blazing fast finality and negligible fees that’s unlocking new financial instruments at scale.

Institutional-Grade Product Launches

The past 18 months have been an institutional on-chain awakening:

BlackRock’s $2.9B BUIDL money market fund lives on Solana
Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX has wallet-native interfaces
Ondo Finance’s USDY tokenized T-bill + yield-bearing is native to Solana
Maple Finance underwrites on-chain credit with real-world legal enforceability
VNX brings commodities like gold on-chain with Solana rails

Even TradFi infrastructure is bridging over. R3’s Corda, used by Euroclear and HSBC, is integrating with Solana’s runtime. That’s $10B+ in legacy assets crossing the digital Rubicon.

The Solana RWA Stack: An Ecosystem Map

On Solana, RWAs are not self-contained entities unto themselves rather, they compose into a stack:

Issuers: VNX, Maple, Ondo
Custodians & Trusts: Fireblocks, Anchorage
Data & Risk: RedStone, Pyth, Switchboard
DeFi Frontends: Jupiter, Sanctum, Kamino, MarginFi

and many more other RWA ecosystem.

Solana’s native DeFi feature liquidity, composability, and global user base make it the first L1 to enable RWA atomicity where tokenized T-bills, DEX trades, and loans interact with each other in a single block.

Jurisdictional Trends: Regulatory Moment

Regulators across the globe are coming in to tokenization but at different speeds.

USA: Tokenization of T-bills is successful in legal wrappers, though SEC position limits wider innovation
Switzerland: FINMA recognizes digital securities as part of regulated issuance
Singapore: MAS has organized sandboxes for RWAs + DeFi pilots
India: Now emerging as the dark horse

India’s IFSC Authority published a March 2025 consultation paper proposing:

DeFi is okay, but only if it’s run by trusted, licensed companies.
If you buy tokens, there should be clear rules on how to get your money back, where your tokens are stored, and what to do if there’s a problem
If a company wants to issue tokenized shares, it should also list them on a regular stock exchange
Venture capital funds should be able to easily operate in GIFT City.

In short, they’re building a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world carefully, step by step.

India’s SEBI sandbox is testing:

India isn’t just following the global trend in tokenized finance it’s building its own path.

Today, we’re seeing tokenized T-bills and government securities, and even gold-backed digital products starting to reach Indian retail investors. The goal? To move away from paper-based systems and bring all of traditional finance onto the blockchain fully dematerialized, fully digital.

Startups like BharatX and Matic Labs are leading the way using Solana to build real-world solutions like.

Financing for small businesses using tokenized invoices
Loans backed by real estate
Cross-border token flows, letting Gulf investors invest into India seamlessly
India isn’t trying to catch up it’s laying its own tracks toward a tokenized financial future.

Future Use Cases: Where Tokenization Goes Next

Most projects today tokenize what already exists Treasuries, gold, equity. But Solana opens the door to new formats:

Tokenized Payroll Streams: Salaries paid directly in stable coins that earn T-bill yields from day one.
Retail Bond Markets: Local governments issuing digital bonds to fund roads, schools, and hospitals citizens invest with a click
Real-World Network Finance: DePIN projects using their hardware (like routers or sensors) as collateral to raise capital.
Dual Listings: IPO-style equity listings that happen both on Solana and on India’s stock exchange letting NRIs invest easily from abroad

With one of the largest diasporas in the world, India could offer millions of global investors direct, compliant access to on-chain Indian assets.

“T
okenization isn’t the endgame. It’s the first step to programmable capital markets.”

RWA Risks: What Could Go Wrong

Even with all the excitement around tokenized finance, there are still big hurdles to overcome:

Custody is tricky: Moving assets from the real world to the blockchain still relies on trusted middlemen. We need better bridges to make it seamless.
Bad data can break everything: If oracles feed wrong prices or info, it can mess up how RWAs are valued and that can ripple through DeFi systems.
The law isn’t clear yet: Different countries have different rules. For global tokenized finance to work, we need more legal clarity and cooperation.
Everyone’s chasing the same yield: If too many people tokenize things like Treasuries, the returns shrink and the edge or alpha disappears.

So while progress is real, the road to a fully tokenized future still has speed bumps.

Conclusion: Solana as the Finternet’s Financial Kernel

“Whereas the internet created a better standard for how text, photos, audio, and video were exchanged, DeFi will create a better standard for how assets are exchanged.” — Teej Ragsdale for Nasdaq

Early crypto experiments like DeFi and NFTs were just the beginning. They were the blueprints.

Real World Assets (RWAs) are something bigger: they’re actual capital and capital needs solid infrastructure to flow safely and efficiently.

That’s where Solana comes in. It’s not just another blockchain it’s becoming the financial backbone of a new kind of internet the Finternet. A system where the lines between traditional finance and crypto start to disappear.

From Bengaluru to New York, from IPO markets to DeFi protocols, the next layer of global finance isn’t being built by big banks or governments.
It’s being built by developers, open-source code, decentralized systems, and people around the world.

And right now, it’s all happening on Solana.
